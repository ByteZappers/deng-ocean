				<h4>BECKING COFFEE -<br>
A German coffee
manufacture</h4>
				<p>Since 1928, Becking is known for its processing of just the fines coffee beans directly acquired from independent farmers.
				<br><br>
				The Arabica Coffees are produced without the incorporation of lesser beans from Vietnam or other countries that generally use chemicals to enhance the efficiency of their production. Becking coffee distances itself vehemently from the use of chemicals in their production process. Furthermore, Becking Coffee works is exclusively working with farmers who work under sustainable conditions and in a fair trade environment. <br><br>
				In its own roasting facilities in Hamburg, Germany, the company is processing the beans in a drum roaster for more than 20 minutes to assure a gentle roast to coffee or espresso. Then, the ground beans are wrapped in high quality golden aluminum packaging.
				<br><br>
				All coffees are packaged directly after roasting and therefore preserve their uniqueness for at least 1.5 years.
