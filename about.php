			Deng Ocean Beijing Trading LTD. has to be seen as the collaboration of the second and third generations’ effort of a family business.  In the 1970s and 80s first trade business with China focused on the export of textiles and running a flourishing wholesale business in Hamburg, Germany. The changing global market and the new generations’ preferences lead to a shift in the core product supply towards food supplements.
			<br><br>
			In 2011 the time was finally ripe to turn the trade business around and use the accumulated knowledge to advance into the demands of global trade in the 21st 
			<br><br>
			century. It was time to start the import business to China. As could be expected we faced a number of challenges whilst applying existing knowledge to a close but not similar trade. First and foremost a Chinese legal entity had to be established. This happened in the Form of Deng Ocean Beijing Trading LTD.. The second phase mostly concentrated on acquiring the necessary license to be a general importer. Once this was achieved a product line had to be fixed to enter the Chinese market. By here at the latest our existing knowledge of the dynamics of the Chinese market proved to be extremely valuable. Furthermore, all products demand specific import processes which have now to be established to fully concentrate on the distribution.
			<br><br>
			At present we are running an office with a storage unit in Beijing with a young and motivated team to conquer the Chinese consumer market and expand our knowledge and position every day.</p>
