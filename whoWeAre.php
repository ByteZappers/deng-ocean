				<h5>History</h5>
				<p>Deng Ocean Beijing Trading is the youngest development based on three generations of family trade between Germany and China. The family’s roots are in textile trade which evolved over time towards offering food products to the production industry. Whit disposable income and wealth rising in China while the peoples taste became more refined, a demand for imported food grew steadily. This lead to focusing the family business on the export of European food products to China. 
				Deng Ocean started by importing chocolate, wine and other food products relying on their mature network of suppliers.  Over the next years Deng Ocean moved towards offering their experience as a service to distributors and producers internationally. 
				Right now, Deng Ocean is experiencing a period of growth fueled by stable supply and reliable retail channels.

				<h5>Mission And Vision</h5>
				<div class="div-50-no-pa">
					<p>We have made it our purpose, our mission and our vision to provide consumers in China with healthy, competitively affordable and sustainable products. Our main experience lies in the provision of food products, but our vision stretches beyond that to household items, toys, car parts and more.
					<br/>
					Currently the western food industry has moved towards supplying products as directly between producer and consumer as possible. Some farmers deliver their wares directly to consumers and some food producers start to sell their products online without any retailer or trader to aid them. Mostly though, producers offer their products in retail channels through retail brands or their own labels. It should be noted that the wholesale market is becoming extinct. We welcome this development and make it our mission to support this development and its positive impact for the consumer.  
					<br/>
					We achieve this mission and vision by carefully selecting clients with the highest integrity, experience and ability. We further invite people to work with us who will put the needs of the many before the needs of the few and thus realize long term growth for the global community of producers, consumers and service agents around us. 
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="div-50-no-pa">
					<p>
						For the moment we will focus on food as we continue to identify great potential for positive change and advancement here. Keeping in mind the rapid advances in purchasing ability and physical education in mainland China, there is a gap that needs to be bridged. Chinses consumers demand high quality food products and they know exactly what the value of these products is. It is our mission to fulfil this need and to grow with our customers desires. 
						<br/>
						In accordance with the above we strive to provide the Chinese retailers with the knowledge and abilities necessary to stay competitive. We make it our mission to facilitate the purchasing and sustainable distribution of food products in mainland China. We further make it our vision to see the highest quality products for competitive prices on the tables of Chinese families.
